== JDAO ==

Java Database Access Object -- not another ORM layer

* tries to combine the simplicity of PHP's PDO
* with the richness of Spring's JDBCTemplate
* thin (not tiny) layer over Apache's DBUtils and DBCP
* can build common query code based on templating with simple maps and lists
* intended to be used in Java as-well-as JVM Scripting Languages
